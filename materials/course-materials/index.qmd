## Publishing

-   Simpler: Render locally, publish on QuartoPub or GitHub Pages (requires your project to be hosted on a GitHub repo)

    ``` bash
    quarto publish quartopub
    quarto publish gh-pages
    ```

-   More complex: Render on the cloud, via a GitHub action (e.g., [this one](https://github.com/data-sci-101/data-sci-101.github.io/blob/main/.github/workflows/build-site.yml)), requires environment management with **renv** or similar.

## Adding webR to your course website {.smaller}

-   Install the Quarto webR extension:

    ``` bash
    quarto add coatless/quarto-webr
    ```

-   For each document, place the `webr` filter in the document's header:

    ``` yaml
    filters:
      - webr
    ```

-   In addition, add the following, listing all packages to be loaded in the page:

    ``` yaml
    webr:
      channel-type: "post-message"
      packages: ['tidyverse', 'scales', 'unvotes']
    ```

-   Then, place the R code for `webR` in a code block marked with `{webr-r}`
