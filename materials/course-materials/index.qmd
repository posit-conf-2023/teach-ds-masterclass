## Publishing

-   Simpler: Render locally, publish on QuartoPub or GitHub Pages (requires your project to be hosted on a GitHub repo)

    ``` bash
    quarto publish quartopub
    quarto publish gh-pages
    ```

-   More complex: Render on the cloud, via a GitHub action (e.g., [this one](https://github.com/data-sci-101/data-sci-101.github.io/blob/main/.github/workflows/build-site.yml)), requires environment management with **renv** or similar.
