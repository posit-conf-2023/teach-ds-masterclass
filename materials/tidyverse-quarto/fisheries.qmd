# Introduction

Fisheries and Aquaculture Department of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations collects data on fisheries production of countries. The (not-so-great) visualization below shows the distribution of fishery harvest of countries for 2016, by capture and aquaculture.

-   Countries whose total harvest was less than 100,000 tons are not included in the visualization.

## Exercise 1

What are some ways you would improve the visualization above?

> Add your response here.

## Packages

We will use the **tidyverse** and **scales** packages for data wrangling and visualization.

```{r}
#| label: load-packages
#| message: false

library(tidyverse)
library(scales)
```

## Data

Let's load the data:

```{r}
#| label: read-fisheries

fisheries <- read_csv("data/fisheries.csv")
```

And inspect it:

```{r}
#| label: glimpse-fisheries

glimpse(fisheries)
```

## Data prep

Filter out countries whose total harvest was less than 100,000 tons since they are not included in the visualization:

```{r}
#| label: filter-total

fisheries <- fisheries |>
  filter(total > 100000)
```

Then, we will join this with the continent data.

```{r}
#| label: read-continents

continents <- read_csv("data/continents.csv")
```

# Data joins

## Exercise 2

We want to keep all rows and columns from `fisheries` and add a column for corresponding continents. Which join function should we use? Explain your reasoning.

> Add your response here.

## Exercise 3

Join the two data frames with `fisheries <- *_join(fisheries, continents)` using the join function you decided on in the previous question. How does this function know to join the two data frames by `country`?

Hint: Take a look at the variables in the two datasets you're joining.

```{r}
#| label: join

# add code here
```

## Exercise 4

Do all countries in `fisheries` have a `continent` assigned? If not, which countries are missing `continent`s (`NA`s)?

> Add your response here

```{r}
#| label: identify-missing

# add code here
```

## Exercise 5

Fill in the missing continents for these countries and justify your decisions. Then check to make sure all countries now have continents assigned.

```{r}
#| label: fill-missing-continents

# add code here
```

## Exercise 6

Calculate the percentage of aquaculture harvest for each country, record these values in a new variable called `aquaculture_perc`.

```{r}
#| label: aquaculture-perc

# add code here
```

## Exercise 7

Calculate minimum, mean, and maximum aquaculture percentage for each continent and visualize these values as a bar plot.

```{r}
#| label: continent-mean-bar
#| fig-height: 7
#| fig-asp: 0.618

# add code here
```
