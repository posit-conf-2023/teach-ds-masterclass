# Teaching with Quarto

## Why Quarto?

::: incremental
-   **Reproducibility:** Train new analysts whose only workflow is a reproducible one
-   **Pedagogy:**
    -   Code + output + prose together
    -   Syntax highlighting FTW!
    -   Familiar-feeling authoring with the visual editor without having to learn a bunch of new markdown syntax
-   **Efficiency:** Consistent formatting -\> easier grading
-   **Extendability:** Use with Python, and Julia, and Observable, and more
:::

## Tips for starting with Quarto

-   Minimal YAML
-   Minimal chunk options
-   Use well scaffolded Quarto documents
-   Render early and often!

## Demo: Quarto ðŸ’™ visual editor

# Teaching with the tidyverse

## Building a curriculum

-   Start with `library(tidyverse)`

-   Teach by learning goals, not packages

![](images/data-science-packages.png){fig-align="center" width="800"}

## Teaching consistently

-   Challenge: Google and Stack Overflow can be less useful -- demo problem solving

-   Counter-proposition: teach *all* (or multiple) syntaxes at once -- trying to teach two (or more!) syntaxes at once will slow the pace of the course, introduce unnecessary syntactic confusion, and make it harder for students to complete their work.

-   "Disciplined in what we teach, liberal in what we accept"

:::

## Keeping up with the tidyverse {.nostretch}

-   Blog posts highlight updates, along with the reasoning behind them and worked examples

-   [Teaching the tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/blog/2023/08/teach-tidyverse-23/) blog post series provides a roughly annual review

-   [Lifecycle stages](https://lifecycle.r-lib.org/articles/stages.html) and badges

![](images/lifecycle.png){fig-align="center" width="699"}

## Community

-   The encouraging and inclusive tidyverse community is one of the benefits of the paradigm

-   Each package comes with a website, each of these websites are similarly laid out, and results of example code are displayed, and extensive vignettes describe how to use various functions from the package together

## Discussion

::: task
Do you teach with the tidyverse?

-   If yes, what are some highlights of your teaching experience and what are some challenges?

-   If no, what is your approach and, if you've considered the tidyverse but decided against it, why?

Any other discussion points of interest?

<br>

> We are all converts to the tidyverse and have made a conscious choice to use it in our research and our teaching. We each learned R without the tidyverse and have all spent quite a few years teaching without it at a variety of levels from undergraduate introductory statistics courses to graduate statistical computing courses. This paper is a synthesis of the reasons supporting our tidyverse choice, along with benefits and challenges associated with teaching statistics with the tidyverse.
