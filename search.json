Where a limitation of liability is not allowed in full or in part, this limitation may not apply to You.\nThe disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and waiver of all liability.\n\n\n\nSection 6 – Term and Termination.\n\nThis Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License terminate automatically.\nWhere Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under Section 6(a), it reinstates:\n\nautomatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the violation; or\nupon express reinstatement by the Licensor.\n\nFor the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations of this Public License.\nFor the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so will not terminate this Public License.\nSections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public License.\n\n\n\nSection 7 – Other Terms and Conditions.\n\nThe Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.\nAny arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.t stated herein are separate from and independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.\n\n\n\nSection 8 – Interpretation.\n\nFor the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully be made without permission under this Public License.\nTo the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable.

At times we will be demoing workflows for instructors (whom I assume are familiar with R, RStudio, and the tidyverse and have taught with or are interested in teaching with Posit Cloud, Git, and GitHub) and at other times you will be working through the student view (on Posit Cloud, assuming you’re not using your local setup).\n\nWatch\nFor the latter, you can mostly assume that you’re a student in an intro data science course and this is the first day of class (i.e. there’s no expectation of prep). However we’d also like to give you a taste of how the remainder of the semester goes, which often entails students watching background videos to prepare. To prepare for the first module, please watch the following video.\n\n\n\n🖥️ Slides\n\n\n\n\nSet up\nFor the former, you’ll might need to prepare a bit more. If you already are a Git and GitHub user, have a personal token saved, and can push to and pull from GitHub without having to type your password in each time, you’re good to go. If not, please complete the following steps before the workshop1. If you need help with any of the steps, please ask on GitHub Discussions.\n\nRegister a free GitHub account\nInstall or update R and RStudio\nInstall Git\nIntroduce yourself to Git\nPersonal access token for HTTPS\nConnect to GitHub\nConnect RStudio to Git and GitHub\nDetect Git from RStudio\n\n\n\nInstall\nIf you choose to use your local R and RStudio install for the workshop, you should also install the following packages:\n\ninstall.packages(\"devtools\")\ninstall.packages(\"DT\")\ninstall.packages(\"fivethirtyeight\")\ninstall.packages(\"gapminder\")\ninstall.packages(\"ghclass\")\ninstall.packages(\"nycflights13\")\ninstall.packages(\"openintro\")\ninstall.packages(\"rvest\")\ninstall.packages(\"shiny\")\ninstall.packages(\"sortable\")\ninstall.packages(\"tidyverse\")\ninstall.packages(\"tidymodels\")\ninstall.packages(\"unvotes\")"
